    <string name="bio_text">Hi, my name is Aleks.
                 \n\nI love fish.
                 \n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
                 \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
                 \n\nI like eating fish, too.<b> Raw fish</b>. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
                 \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
                 \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
                 \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
                 \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
                 \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
